let's kick the tyres by launching the sample Repospective app\nbundled with this project to demo some of its best features:\n npm run setup && npm start\n\n\nOpen localhost:3000 to see it in action.\n\nAdd a Github username to see Redux and Redux Sagas in action: effortless\nasync state updates and side effects are now yours :)\nEdit the file at ./app/containers/HomePage/index.js so that the text of\nthe  component reads \"Features!!!\"... Hot Module Reloading gives\nyou a feedback loop with your UI so smooth it's almost conversational!\nClick your (newly emphatic) Features button to see React Router in action...\nNow you can share a direct link to that content privately over your LAN or\nglobally addressable to any device, anywhere. Not bad for a locally-running\nSingle Page App.\n\n\nTime to build your own app: run\n npm run clean\n\n ...and use the built-in generators to start your first feature.\n\n\nDevelopment\nRun npm start to see your app at localhost:3000\nBuilding & Deploying\n\nRun npm run build, which will compile all the necessary files to the\nbuild folder.\n\nUpload the contents of the build folder to your web server's root folder.\n\n\nStructure\nThe app/ directory contains your entire application code, including CSS,\nJavaScript, HTML and tests.\nThe rest of the folders and files only exist to make your life easier, and\nshould not need to be touched.\n(If they do have to be changed, please submit an issue!)\nCSS\nUtilising tagged template literals\n(a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS,\nstyled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components.\nIt also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a\nlow-level styling construct could not be easier!\nSee the CSS documentation for more information.\nJS\nWe bundle all your clientside scripts and chunk them into several files using\ncode splitting where possible. We then automatically optimize your code when\nbuilding for production so you don't have to worry about that.\nSee the JS documentation for more information about the\nJavaScript side of things.\nSEO\nWe use react-helmet for managing document head tags. Examples on how to\nwrite head tags can be found here.\nTesting\nFor a thorough explanation of the testing procedure, see the\ntesting documentation!\nBrowser testing\nnpm run start:tunnel makes your locally-running app globally available on the web\nvia a temporary URL: great for testing on different devices, client demos, etc!\nUnit testing\nUnit tests live in test/ directories right next to the components being tested\nand are run with npm run test.\n"},"general/":{"url":"general/","title":"General","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nThe JavaScript ecosystem evolves at incredible speed: staying current can feel\noverwhelming. So, instead of you having to stay on top of every new tool,\nfeature and technique to hit the headlines, this project aims to lighten the\nload by providing a curated baseline of the most valuable ones.\nUsing React Boilerplate, you get to start your app with our community's current\nideas on what represents optimal developer experience, best practice, most\nefficient tooling and cleanest project structure.\n\nCLI Commands\nTool Configuration\nServer Configurations\nDeployment (currently Heroku specific)\nFAQ\nGotchas\n\nFeature overview\nQuick scaffolding\nAutomate the creation of components, containers, routes, selectors and sagas -\nand their tests - right from the CLI!\nRun npm run generate in your terminal and choose one of the parts you want\nto generate. They'll automatically be imported in the correct places and have\neverything set up correctly.\n\nWe use plop to generate new components, you can find all the logic and\ntemplates for the generation in internals/generators.\n\nInstant feedback\nEnjoy the best DX and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes\nto the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page.\nPreserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!\nPredictable state management\nWe use Redux to manage our applications state. We have also added optional\nsupport for the Chrome Redux DevTools Extension – if you have it installed,\nyou can see, play back and change your action history!\nNext generation JavaScript\nUse ESNext template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax\nand more, today. This is possible thanks to Babel with the latest, stage-0\nand react presets!\nNext generation CSS\nWrite composable CSS that's co-located with your components using styled-components\nfor complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low\nwhile eliminating style clashes. Ship only the styles that are used on the\nvisible page for the best performance.\nIndustry-standard routing\nIt's natural to want to add pages (e.g. /about) to your application, and\nrouting makes this possible. Thanks to react-router with react-router-redux,\nthat's as easy as pie and the url is auto-synced to your application state!\nOptional extras\nDon't like any of these features? Click here\nOffline-first\nThe next frontier in performant web apps: availability without a network\nconnection from the instant your users load the app. This is done with a\nServiceWorker and a fallback to AppCache, so this feature even works on older\nbrowsers!\n\nAll your files are included automatically. No manual intervention needed\nthanks to Webpack's offline-plugin\n\nAdd To Homescreen\nAfter repeat visits to your site, users will get a prompt to add your application\nto their homescreen.

(see app.js\nand App/styles.css)\nAdding a new font\n\nEither add the @font-face declaration to App/styles.css or add a \ntag to the index.html. (Don't forget to remove the \nfor Open Sans from the index.html!)\n\nIn App/styles.css, specify your initial font-family in the body tag\nwith only web-save fonts.

Continue below to see what that looks like.\n\nMocha\nMocha is our unit testing framework. Its API, which we write tests with, is\nspeech like and easy to use.\n\nNote: This is the official documentation of Mocha.\n\nWe're going to add a second file called add.test.js with our unit tests\ninside. Running said unit tests requires us to enter mocha add.test.js into\nthe command line.\nFirst, we import the function in our add.test.js file:\n// add.test.js\n\nimport { add } from './add.js';\n\nSecond, we describe our function:\ndescribe('add()', () => {\n\n});\n\n\nNote: (arg1, arg2) => { } is ES6 notation for anonymous functions, i.e. is\nthe same thing as function(arg1, arg2) { }\n\nThird, we tell Mocha what it (our function) should do:\ndescribe('add()', () => {\n  it('adds two numbers', () => {\n\n  });\n\n  it('doesnt add the third number', () => {\n\n  });\n});\n\nThat's the entire Mocha part! Onwards to the actual tests.\nexpect\nUsing expect, we expect our little function to return the same thing every\ntime given the same input.\n\nNote: This is the official documentation for expect.\n\nFirst, we have to import expect at the top of our file, before the tests:\nimport expect from 'expect';\n\ndescribe('add()', () => {\n  // [...]\n});\n\nWe're going to test that our little function correctly adds two numbers first.\nWe are going to take some chosen inputs, and expect the result toEqual the\ncorresponding output:\n// [...]\nit('adds two numbers', () => {\n  expect(add(2, 3)).toEqual(5);\n});\n// [...]\n\nLets add the second test, which determines that our function doesn't add the\nthird number if one is present:\n// [...]\nit('doesnt add the third number', () => {\n expect(add(2, 3, 5)).toEqual(add(2, 3));\n});\n// [...]\n\n\nNote: Notice that we call add in toEqual. I won't tell you why, but just\n  think about what would happen if we rewrote the expect as expect(add(2, 3, 5)).toEqual(5)\n  and somebody broke something in the add function. What would this test\n  actually... test?\n\nShould our function work, Mocha will show this output when running the tests:\nadd()\n  ✓ adds two numbers\n  ✓ doesnt add the third number\nLets say an unnamed colleague of ours breaks our function:\n// add.js\n\nexport function add(x, y) {\n  return x * y;\n}\n\nOh no, now our function doesn't add the numbers anymore, it multiplies them!\nImagine the consequences to our code that uses the function!\nThankfully, we have unit tests in place. Because we run the unit tests before we\ndeploy our application, we see this output:\nadd()\n  1) adds two numbers\n  ✓ doesnt add the third number\n\n  1) add adds two numbers:\n    Error: Expected 6 to equal 5\nThis tells us that something is broken in the add function before any users get\nthe code! Congratulations, you just saved time and money!\nTesting Redux Applications\nThis boilerplate uses Redux, partially because it turns our data flow into\ntestable (pure) functions. Let's go back to our NavBar component from above,\nand see what testing the actions and the reducer of it would look like.\nThis is what our NavBar actions look like:\n// NavBar.actions.js\n\nimport { TOGGLE_NAV } from './NavBar.constants.js';\n\nexport function toggleNav() {\n  return { type: TOGGLE_NAV };\n}\n\nwith this reducer:\n// NavBar.reducer.js\n\nimport { TOGGLE_NAV } from './NavBar.constants.js';\n\nconst initialState = {\n  open: false\n};\n\nfunction NavBarReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case TOGGLE_NAV:\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\n        open: !state.open\n      });\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default NavBarReducer;\n\nLets test the reducer first!\nReducers\nFirst, we have to import expect, the reducer and the constant.\n// NavBar.reducer.test.js\n\nimport expect from 'expect';\nimport NavBarReducer from '../NavBar.reducer';\nimport { TOGGLE_NAV } from '../NavBar.constants';\n\nThen we describe the reducer, and add two tests: we check that it returns the\ninitial state and that it handles the toggleNav action.\ndescribe('NavBarReducer', () => {\n  it('returns the initial state', () => {\n\n  });\n\n  it('handles the toggleNav action', () => {\n\n  });\n});\n\nLets write the tests themselves! Since the reducer is just a function, we can\ncall it like any other function and expect the output to equal something.\nTo test that it returns the initial state, we call it with a state of undefined\n(the first argument), and an empty action (second argument). The reducer should\nreturn the initial state of the NavBar, which is\n{\n  open: false\n}\n\nLets put that into practice:\ndescribe('NavBarReducer', () => {\n  it('returns the initial state', () => {\n    expect(NavBarReducer(undefined, {})).toEqual({\n      open: false\n    });\n  });\n\n  it('handles the toggleNav action', () => {\n\n  });\n});\n\nThis works, but we have one problem: We also test the initial state itself. When\nsomebody changes the initial state, this test will fail, even though the reducer\ncorrectly returns the initial state.\nTo fix that, we have to import the initial state from the reducer file and\ncheck that the reducer returns that. This has one problem: Our initial state\nisn't exported.\nNow, you might be thinking \"Ha! easy: simply add an export before the\nconst initialState in the reducer and boom!\"... But in fact we don't want\nto do that because it's an internal (or \"private\") property of that module\nalone and shouldn't really be accessible from the outside at all.\nThis is where the rewire module comes in handy.\nrewire\nRewire allows us to access properties we normally couldn't via special\n__get__ and __set__ methods it injects into modules.\nStart by importing rewire at the top of your test file:\n// `NavBar.reducer.test.js`\n\nimport expect from 'expect';\nimport rewire from 'rewire';\nimport NavBarReducer from '../NavBar.reducer';\nimport { TOGGLE_NAV } from '../NavBar.constants';\n\nconst initialState = NavBarReducer.__get__('initialState');\n\n\nNote: You might be wondering why we still import the NavBarReducer above.\n  The NavBarReducer imported with rewire isn't the actual reducer, it's a\n  rewired version.\n\nNow we can really see whether the NavBarReducer returns the initial state if\nno action is passed!\nit('returns the initial state', () => {\n  expect(NavBarReducer(undefined, {})).toEqual(initialState);\n});\n\nw00t, we fixed the test!\n\nFor more information on Rewire, see the official documentation\n\nLets see how we can test actions next.\nActions\nWe have one action toggleNav that changes the NavBar open state.\nA Redux action is a pure function, so testing it isn't more difficult than\ntesting our add function from the first part of this guide!\nThe first step is to import the action to be tested, the constant it should\nreturn and expect:\n// NavBar.actions.test.js\n\nimport { toggleNav } from '../NavBar.actions';\nimport { TOGGLE_NAV } from '../NavBar.constants';\nimport expect from 'expect';\n\nThen we describe the actions:\ndescribe('NavBar actions', () => {\n  describe('toggleNav', () => {\n    it('should return the correct constant', () => {\n\n    });\n  });\n});\n\n\nNote: describes can be nested, which gives us nice output, as we'll see later.\n\nAnd the last step is to add the assertion:\nit('should return the correct constant', () => {\n  expect(toggleNav()).toEqual({\n    type: TOGGLE_NAV\n  });\n});\n\nIf our toggleNav action works correctly, this is the output Mocha will show us:\nNavBar actions\n  toggleNav\n    ✓ should return the correct constant\nAnd that's it, we now know when somebody breaks the toggleNav action!\nContinue to learn how to test your application with Component Testing!\n"},"testing/component-testing.html":{"url":"testing/component-testing.html","title":"Component Testing","keywords":"","body":"Component testing\nUnit testing your Redux actions and reducers is nice, but you\ncan do even more to make sure nothing breaks your application.

Lets take a look at what that\nmeans with a simple  component...\nThis component renders a  element containing a checkmark icon and some\ntext:\n// Button.react.js\n\nimport CheckmarkIcon from './CheckmarkIcon.react';\n\nfunction Button(props) {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      { React.Children.only(props.children) }\n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default Button;\n\nNote: This is a stateless (\"dumb\") component\nIt might be used in another component like this:\n// HomePage.react.js\n\nimport Button from './Button.react';\n\nclass HomePage extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return(\n      Click me!\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nNote: This is a stateful (\"smart\") component!\nWhen rendered normally with the standard ReactDOM.render function, this will\nbe the HTML output\n(Comments added in parallel to compare structures in HTML from JSX source):\n                                        -->\n      -->\n  Click Me!                        \n                                      -->\n\nConversely, when rendered with the shallow renderer, we'll get a String\ncontaining this \"HTML\":\n                           -->\n     \n  Click Me!           \n                         -->\n\nIf we test our Button with the normal renderer and there's a problem\nwith the CheckmarkIcon then the test for the Button will fail as well...\nbut finding the culprit will be hard. Using the shallow renderer, we isolate\nthe problem's cause since we don't render any other components other than the\none we're testing!\nThe problem with the shallow renderer is that all assertions have to be done\nmanually, and you cannot do anything that needs the DOM.\nThankfully, AirBnB has open sourced their\nwrapper around the React shallow renderer and jsdom, called enzyme. enzyme\nis a testing utility that gives us a nice assertion/traversal/manipulation API.\nEnzyme\nLets test our  component! We're going to assess three things: First,\nthat it renders a HTML  tag, second that it renders its children we\npass it and third that handles clicks!\nThis is our Mocha setup:\ndescribe('', () => {\n  it('renders a ', () => {});\n\n  it('renders its children', () => {});\n\n  it('handles clicks', () => {});\n});\n\nLets start with testing that it renders a . To do that we first\nshallow render it, and then expect that a  node exists.\nit('renders a ', () => {\n  const renderedComponent = shallow(\n    \n  );\n  expect(\n    renderedComponent.find(\"button\").node\n  ).toExist();\n});\n\nNice! If somebody breaks our button component by having it render an  tag\nor something else we'll immediately know! Let's do something a bit more advanced\nnow, and check that our  renders its children.\nWe render our button component with some text, and then verify that our text\nexists:\nit('renders its children', () => {\n  const text = \"Click me!\";\n  const renderedComponent = shallow(\n    { text }\n  );\n  expect(\n    renderedComponent.contains(text)\n  ).toEqual(true);\n});\n\nGreat! Onwards to our last and most advanced test: checking that our  handles clicks correctly. We'll use a Spy for that. A Spy is a\nfunction that knows if, and how often, it has been called. We create the Spy\n(thoughtfully provided by expect), pass it as the onClick handler to our\ncomponent, simulate a click on the rendered  element and, lastly,\nsee that our Spy was called:\nit('handles clicks', () => {\n  const onClickSpy = expect.createSpy();\n  const renderedComponent = shallow();\n  renderedComponent.find('button').simulate('click');\n  expect(onClickSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();\n});\n\nAnd that's how you unit test your components and make sure they work correctly!\n"},"testing/remote-testing.html":{"url":"testing/remote-testing.html","title":"Remote Testing","keywords":"","body":"Remote testing\nnpm run start:tunnel\n\nThis command will start a server and tunnel it with ngrok.

This allows us to\nefficiently determine if our components need to rerender since we know if the\nprops changed or not!\nCheck out the official documentation\nfor a good explanation of the more intricate benefits it has.\nUsage\nIn our reducers, we make the initial state an immutable data structure with the\nfromJS function. We pass it an object or an array, and it takes care of\nconverting it to a immutable data structure. (Note: the conversion is performed deeply so\nthat even arbitrarily nested arrays/objects are immutable structures too!)\nimport { fromJS } from 'immutable';\n\nconst initialState = fromJS({\n  myData: {\n      message: 'Hello World!'\n  },\n});\n\nWhen a reducer is subscribed to an action and needs to return the new state they can do so by using setter methods such as .set and .update and .merge.If the changing state data is nested, we can utilize the 'deep' versions of these setters: .setIn and .updateIn, .mergeIn.\nimport { SOME_ACTION, SOME_OTHER_ACTION } from './actions';\n\n// […]\n\nfunction myReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SOME_ACTION:\n      return state.set('myData', action.payload);\n    case SOME_OTHER_ACTION:\n      return state.setIn(['myData', 'message'], action.payload);\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n\nWe use reselect to efficiently cache our computed application\nstate. Since that state is now immutable, we need to use the .get and .getIn\nfunctions to select the part we want.\nconst myDataSelector = (state) => state.get('myData');\nconst messageSelector = (state) => state.getIn(['myData', 'message']);\n\nexport default myDataSelector;\n\nTo learn more, check out reselect.md!\nImmutable Records\nImmutableJS provides a number of immutable structures such as Map, Set and List.\nOne drawback to these structures is that properties must be accessed via the getter methods (.get or .getIn) and cannot be accessed with dot notation as they would in a plain javascript object.For instance you'll write map.get('property') instead of object.property, and list.get(0) instead of array[0].This can make your code a little harder to follow and requires you to be extra cautious when passing arguments or props to functions or components that try to access values with regular dot notation.ImmutableJS's Record structure offers a solution to this issue.\nA Record is similar to a Map but has a fixed shape, meaning it's property keys are predefined and you can't later add a new property after the record is created. Attempting to set new properties will cause an error.One benefit of Record is that you can now, along with other immutable read methods (.get, .set, .merge and so on), use the dot notation to access properties.\nThe creation of a record is less simple than simply calling .toJS().First, you have to define the Record shape. With the example above, to create your initial state, you'll write:\n// Defining the shape\nconst StateRecord = Record({\n  myData: {\n      message: 'Hello World!'\n  }\n});\n\nconst initialState = new StateRecord({}); // initialState is now a new StateRecord instance\n                                          // initialized with myData.message set by default as 'Hello World!'\n\nNow, if you want to access myData, you can just write state.myData in your reducer code and to access the message property you can write state.myData.message as you would in a plain javascript object.\nGotchas of Using Records\nAlthough dot notation can now be used to read properties the same does not apply to setting properties. Any attempts to set a property on a Record using dot notation will result in errors. \nInstead setter methods ( .set, .update, .merge) should be used.\nCertain properties can not be set on a record as they would conflict with the API. Consider the below example:\nconst ProductRecord = Record({\n    type: 'tshirt',\n    size: 'small'\n});\n\nBecause record.size is used to return the records count (similar to array.length), the above definition would throw an error.\n"},"js/reselect.html":{"url":"js/reselect.html","title":"reselect","keywords":"","body":"reselect\nreselect memoizes (\"caches\") previous state trees and calculations based on said\ntree. This means repeated changes and calculations are fast and efficient,\nproviding us with a performance boost over standard mapStateToProps\nimplementations.\nThe official documentation\noffers a good starting point!\nUsage\nThere are two different kinds of selectors, simple and complex ones.\nSimple selectors\nSimple selectors are just that: they take the application state and select a\npart of it.\nconst mySelector = (state) => state.get('someState');\n\nexport {\n  mySelector,\n};\n\nComplex selectors\nIf we need to, we can combine simple selectors to build more complex ones which\nget nested state parts with reselect's createSelector function. We import other\nselectors and pass them to the createSelector call:\nimport { createSelector } from 'reselect';\nimport mySelector from 'mySelector';\n\nconst myComplexSelector = createSelector(\n  mySelector,\n  (myState) => myState.get('someNestedState')\n);\n\nexport {\n  myComplexSelector,\n};\n\nThese selectors can then either be used directly in our containers as\nmapStateToProps functions or be nested with createSelector once again:\nexport default connect(createSelector(\n  myComplexSelector,\n  (myNestedState) => ({ data: myNestedState })\n))(SomeComponent);\n\nAdding a new selector\nIf you have a selectors.js file next to the reducer which's part of the state\nyou want to select, add your selector to said file.

It works\nbeautifully for data fetching, concurrent computations and a lot more.\nSebastien Lorber put it best:\n\nImagine there is widget1 and widget2. When some button on widget1 is clicked,\n  then it should have an effect on widget2. Instead of coupling the 2 widgets\n  together (ie widget1 dispatch an action that targets widget2), widget1 only\n  dispatch that its button was clicked. Then the saga listen for this button\n  click and then update widget2 by dispatching a new event that widget2 is aware of.\nThis adds a level of indirection that is unnecessary for simple apps, but make\n  it more easy to scale complex applications. You can now publish widget1 and\n  widget2 to different npm repositories so that they never have to know about\n  each others, without having them to share a global registry of actions.

Here we see the component including the messages.js file, which contains all the default component text, organized with ids (and optionally descriptions). We are also importing the FormattedMessage component, which will display a given message from the messages.js file in the selected language.\nYou will also notice a more complex use of FormattedMessage for the author message where alternate or variable values (i.e. author: Max Stoiber,) are being injected, in this case it's a react component.\nimport React from 'react';\n\nimport messages from './messages';\nimport A from 'components/A';\nimport styles from './styles.css';\nimport { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl';\n\nfunction Footer() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Max Stoiber,\n            }}\n          />\n        \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default Footer;\n\nExtracting i18n JSON files\nYou can extract all i18n language within each component by running the following command:\n  npm run extract-intl\nThis will extract all language into i18n JSON files in app/translations.\nAdding A Language\nYou can add a language by running the generate command:\n  npm run generate language\nThen enter the two character i18n standard language specifier (e.g. \"fr\", \"de\", \"es\" - without quotes).
